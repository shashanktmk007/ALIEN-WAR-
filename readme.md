  Virtual Reality is defined as "the use of computer technology to create a simulated environment."
When you view VR, you are viewing a completely different reality than the one in front of you.
Virtual reality may be artificial, such as an animated scene, or an actual place that has been photographed and included in a virtual reality app.
With virtual reality, you can move around and look in every direction -- up, down, sideways and behind you, as if you were physically there.
You can view virtual reality through a special VR viewer, such as the Oculus Rift. Other virtual reality viewers use your phone and VR apps, such as Google Cardboard or Daydream View.
